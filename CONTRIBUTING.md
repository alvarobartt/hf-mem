First off, thanks for your interest in contributing! `hf-mem` is intentionally lightweight, simple, and slightly opinionated. The goal is to keep the code clean, predictable, and free of unnecessary layers (i.e., avoid over-engineering).

- Fixes, small improvements, and patches are appreciated.
- Please don't add external dependencies or large new abstractions.
- Follow the existing style and patterns; they are intentional.
- Large structural changes or rewrites will not be accepted.

### How to contribute

1. Open an issue for discussion before submitting any non-trivial PRs.
2. Keep your changes minimal and focused.
3. Write clear commit messages and describe the change in plain terms.

I appreciate practical, thoughtful contributions that align with the project.
