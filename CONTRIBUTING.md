Thanks for your interest in contributing to `hf-mem`!

`hf-mem` is intentionally lightweight, simple, and slightly opinionated. The goal is to keep the code clean, predictable, and free of unnecessary layers (i.e., avoid over-engineering).

- Fixes, small improvements, and patches are appreciated.
- Please don't add external dependencies or large new abstractions.
- Follow the existing style and patterns; they are intentional.
- Large structural changes or rewrites will not be accepted.

### How to contribute

1. Open an issue for discussion before submitting any non-trivial PRs.
2. Keep your changes minimal and focused.
3. Write clear commit messages and describe the change in plain terms.

I appreciate practical, thoughtful contributions that align with the project.

### Maintained by humans

`hf-mem` is maintained by humans, please bear that in mind before submitting issues and PRs, particularly when using AI assistance. Using AI is of course not prohibited, but needs to be used thoughtfully, as this repository is intentionally opinionated (maybe not correct, but opinionated), so not every contribution will be accepted.

While not identical, I like to thing that `hf-mem` stands on similar principles as [Ghostty](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty) as well as other open-source projects publicly opinionated on AI usage, see [Ghostty AI Policy](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/blob/main/AI_POLICY.md).
